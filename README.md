# SmartGuard

Problem statement:
Infrastructure is getting “smart”, with sensors and Internet of things (IoT) increasingly embedded in the built environment (e.g. Punggol Digital District). How might we leverage a network of smart infrastructure in the built environment to make better and more timely sense of emergency incidents (e.g. detection of fires developing, building collapses, falls, road traffic accidents etc.) and trigger early intervention measures, without the need to activate precious emergency resources?

Our solution: SmartGuard is an all in one cloud-based AI-driven mobile application that takes data collected from sensors and IoT embedded in our community together with public reporting to predicting anomaly or potential hazard within the community. This is achieved using our state-of-the-art Machine learning algorithms to do fire and anomaly detection via public accessible data such as https://data.gov.sg/.
This aim of this application is to facilitate the flow of valuable information between users to ensure that everyone is alert about potential hazard near them and hence allowing them to carry out early-stage interventions and as result prevent wastage of emergency resource.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Load the flutter file into your SDK, set up emulator Nexus 6 with Pie OS for ideal virtual device. 

Alternativly you can download the *app-release.apk* and install it into your mobile application for testing.

They are two submodule consisting of the code for anomly detection and fire detection alogrithms. Please click on it to access that code.

-Fire_Image_Classifier @d10a95b

-weather-anomaly @13cd811

All ML model has be implemented into the flutter application.
